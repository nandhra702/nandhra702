# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sukhraj  

Iâ€™m passionate about building tools that blend **Python and C++** to solve real-world problems. My projects range from **desktop applications** (like Typright Notepad with spellcheck & autocomplete), to **web development with Django**, to **systems involving security, file handling, and plagiarism detection**. I enjoy working on ideas that improve productivity, explore algorithms & DSA concepts, and bring together clean code with practical design.  

Nice to meet you !
